- Title: Double JPEG Detection in Mixed JPEG Quality Factors using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

- Conference: The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)

- Proposed network tensorflow code.

- Trained weights link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HlKSoCGVm_2Gia--MH5Bx3SquJos-kr1.

The network was trained with two dataset. 
First dataset was generated using 1120 quantization tables (mentioned in the paper). 
Second dataset was generated using standard quantization tables (Q50 - Q100).


- Example code will be updated.

- You can download single and double JPEG images and 1120 quantization tables at https://sites.google.com/view/jspark/home/djpeg.
